        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spicy gingerbread men. This is the only recipe we have ever used. For best flavor, do NOT use blackstrap molasses.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup molasses</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until smooth. Stir in molasses and egg yolk. Combine the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg; blend into the molasses mixture until smooth. Cover, and chill for at least one hour.

            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks. Frost or decorate when cool.</li>
        </ol>
